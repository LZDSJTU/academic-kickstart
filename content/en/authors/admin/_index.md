I am currently a perception algorithm engineer at Hikvision Research Institute (Shanghai) researching on 3D point cloud detection. Before that I received my master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Inteliigent Vehicle Lab) in 2020, advised by Associate Professor Chunxiang Wang and Professor Ming Yang, and received my B.Eng from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017.

My research interest focuses on 3D deep learning on point cloud and its applications on autonomous driving. In addition, I used to be the person in charge of the CyberTiggo self-driving system in the Intelligent Vehicle Lab, responsible for integrating and validating the self-driving system, and developing the decision-making, planning and control modules.
